# SU@ PAN'2015: Experiments in Author Profiling.

## Abstract
We describe the submission of the Sofia University team for the Author Profiling Task, part of the PAN 2015 Challenge. Given a set of writing samples by the same person, the task asks to predict some demographical information such as age and gender, as well as the personality type of that person. We experimented with SVM classifiers using variety of features extracted from publicly available resources, achieving the second-best score for Spanish out of 21 submissions, and the sixthbest for English out of 22 submissions.
